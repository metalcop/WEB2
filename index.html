    <h2>World Wide Web</h2>

    <p>
      The <strong>World Wide Web (WWW)</strong>, also called <strong>the Web
      </strong>, is an information space where documents and other web resources
      are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinkedby
      hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet. English scientist Tim
      Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web
      browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. The
      browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research
      institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the
      Internet in August 1991.
    </p>
    <p>
      The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information
      Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the
      Internet. Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and annotated
      with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In addition to formatted text, web
      pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are
      rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. Multiple
      web pages with a common theme, a common domain name, or both, make up a
      website. Website content can largely be provided by the publisher, or
      interactively where users contribute content or the content depends upon
      the users or their actions. Websites may be mostly informative, primarily
      for entertainment, or largely for commercial, governmental, or
      non-governmental organisational purpose.
